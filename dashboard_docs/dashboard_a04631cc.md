## Description

The "Location Cost Summary" dashboard provides a high-level overview of location-based costs for an organization. This dashboard would be useful for executives, finance teams, and operational managers who need to understand and track location-related expenses.

The dashboard has three key components:

1. Fiscal Year Selector: This dropdown filter allows users to view location cost data for a specific fiscal year.

2. Location Cost Rollup: This table displays a summary of total costs broken down by location. Users can see the overall cost for each location, which could be helpful for identifying high-cost or low-cost areas.

3. Location Cost Rollup: This second instance of the location cost table provides another view of the same data, potentially allowing users to sort, filter, or group the information in different ways.

By having multiple instances of the location cost table, the dashboard gives users flexibility to analyze the data from different perspectives. The fiscal year selector also enables them to track changes in location costs over time.

Overall, this dashboard consolidates critical location-based cost information into a centralized view, empowering stakeholders to make more informed decisions about managing and optimizing expenses across the organization's locations.
