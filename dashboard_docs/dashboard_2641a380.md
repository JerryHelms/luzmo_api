## Description

The AK DEED Report dashboard provides a comprehensive view of maintenance and work order data for an organization. It is likely used by facility managers, maintenance supervisors, and operations teams to track and analyze key performance metrics related to their maintenance activities.

The dashboard contains a variety of components, including:

- Dropdown filters to allow users to view data for different fiscal years and workflow stages
- Pivot tables that display detailed breakdowns of maintenance hours, work order counts, and work order hours
- Column charts that visualize trends in initiated vs. completed work orders, as well as scheduled vs. unscheduled work order hours
- A combination chart that shows the relationship between unscheduled work order counts and hours

These components work together to answer critical questions such as:

- How have maintenance hours and work order volumes changed over time?
- What is the balance between scheduled and unscheduled work orders, and how has this changed?
- Which maintenance activities are driving the highest work order volumes and hours?

By consolidating data from multiple sources into a single, interactive dashboard, the AK DEED Report enables facility and maintenance teams to quickly identify areas for process improvement, resource allocation, and preventative maintenance. This information can then be used to optimize maintenance strategies and ensure efficient, cost-effective operations.
