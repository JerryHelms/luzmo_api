## Description

The Sales Trends Dashboard Template is designed to help sales teams and managers uncover both short-term and long-term trends in their sales performance. This comprehensive dashboard provides a wealth of insights to help identify opportunities for revenue growth and improve sales strategies.

The dashboard consolidates a range of key sales metrics into a single, easy-to-navigate view. It tracks critical performance indicators such as open deals, new deals per month, total revenue, revenue per month, close rate, revenue per source, average sales cycle, and reasons for deal refusals. These metrics are presented through a variety of chart types, including column charts, evolution numbers, donut charts, and bar charts.

By monitoring these sales trends over time, users can spot patterns and identify areas for improvement. For example, the "Revenue per source per month" and "Revenue per license per quarter" charts can reveal which products or services are driving the most revenue, allowing teams to focus on their most profitable offerings. The "Deals in the freezer" and "Avg Open deal age" metrics can highlight bottlenecks in the sales funnel, helping managers address any issues with the sales process.

This dashboard would be highly valuable for sales leaders, regional managers, and executives who need to track the overall health and performance of their sales operations. It provides a centralized view of the most important sales metrics, empowering users to make data-driven decisions and optimize their sales strategies for long-term success.
