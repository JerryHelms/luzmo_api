## Description

The Sales Trends Dashboard Template is designed to help sales teams and managers uncover both short-term and long-term trends in their sales performance. This comprehensive dashboard provides a wealth of insights to help identify opportunities for revenue growth and improve sales strategies.

The dashboard consolidates a range of key sales metrics into a single, easy-to-navigate view. It tracks critical performance indicators such as open deals, new deals per month, total revenue, revenue per month, close rate, revenue per source, average sales cycle, and reasons for deal refusals. These metrics are presented through a variety of chart types, including column charts, evolution numbers, donut charts, and bar charts.
