## Description

This internal dashboard, titled "Map From Subscriptions", provides a visual representation of geographic data related to the organization's subscriptions. The dashboard contains three choropleth maps, which are specialized visualizations that display geographic information using color-coded regions.

The purpose of this dashboard is to help the organization better understand the geographic distribution and trends of their subscription base. By analyzing the choropleth maps, users can gain insights into:

1. The geographical spread of the organization's subscriptions - the maps allow users to identify regions with high, medium, and low subscription concentrations.
2. Potential geographic patterns or hotspots - the color-coded regions can highlight areas with particularly strong or weak subscription activity, which could inform sales and marketing strategies.
3. Changes over time - if the dashboard is updated regularly, the choropleth maps can be used to track how the subscription footprint evolves across different regions.

This dashboard would be valuable for various stakeholders within the organization, such as sales, marketing, and customer success teams. They can use the insights provided by the choropleth maps to make data-driven decisions, optimize their geographic coverage, and identify opportunities for growth or retention.

The dashboard sources data from two connected datasets, which suggests the organization has multiple sources of subscription-related information that are being consolidated and visualized in a single place. This integrated view can help users gain a more comprehensive understanding of the organization's subscription performance and trends.

Overall, the "Map From Subscriptions" dashboard serves as a strategic tool for the organization, enabling them to better understand and act upon the geographic aspects of their subscription business.
