This dashboard would be valuable for various stakeholders within the organization, such as sales, marketing, and customer success teams. They can use the insights provided by the choropleth maps to make data-driven decisions, optimize their geographic coverage, and identify opportunities for growth or retention.

The dashboard sources data from two connected datasets, which suggests the organization has multiple sources of subscription-related information that are being consolidated and visualized in a single place.
