The main purpose of this dashboard is to give users a centralized view of the companies that are of interest to the business.

By consolidating all of this company information into a single dashboard, users can quickly scan the data, identify any important updates or changes, and drill into the details of specific companies as needed. This streamlines access to critical business information and supports more informed decision-making.
