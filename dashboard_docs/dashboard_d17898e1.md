## Description

The "Scheduled Requests" dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of upcoming preventive maintenance (PM) tasks for an organization. This dashboard is likely used by maintenance and operations teams to proactively plan and manage their scheduled work.

Additionally, the "Search & Select" components suggest the dashboard allows users to quickly find and focus on specific areas of interest, enabling more targeted planning and analysis.

Overall, this dashboard is a valuable tool for maintenance and operations professionals who need to proactively manage their scheduled work and ensure the reliability and availability of their assets.
