## Description

The Inventory Transactions dashboard provides a comprehensive view of an organization's inventory management activities. It is designed to help inventory managers, procurement teams, and finance professionals track and analyze various aspects of inventory transactions.

The dashboard includes a variety of components that allow users to:

1. Filter and explore inventory data by different criteria, such as location, catalog, transaction type, work order status, storage location, transaction date, and more. This enables users to quickly identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the inventory data.

The dashboard integrates data from a single connected dataset and provides a centralized view of an organization's inventory management operations. By leveraging the various filter and analysis components, users can quickly identify areas of concern, make informed decisions, and optimize inventory management processes.
