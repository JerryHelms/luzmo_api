## Description

The "[Internal] Github Stats" dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key metrics and insights related to an organization's GitHub activity. This dashboard is designed to be used by engineering leaders, project managers, and other stakeholders who need to understand and track the Github-related performance and productivity of their teams.
