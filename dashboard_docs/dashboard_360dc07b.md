## Description

The "[Internal] Github Stats" dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key metrics and insights related to an organization's GitHub activity. This dashboard is designed to be used by engineering leaders, project managers, and other stakeholders who need to understand and track the Github-related performance and productivity of their teams.

The dashboard includes a variety of visualizations and data views that cover different aspects of Github usage, including:

- Releases and build metrics: The dashboard tracks the number of releases, builds on the main branch, build duration, and billable minutes over time. This allows users to monitor the overall release cadence and build health.

- Release and build trends by repository and time period: Line charts, column charts, and bubble charts provide detailed views of release and build activity broken down by repository and time (weekly, monthly). This helps identify trends, patterns, and areas of focus.

- Contributor-level insights: A donut chart shows the distribution of builds by user, providing visibility into who is most active in the codebase.

- Detailed data tables: Two data tables offer a comprehensive, filterable view of the underlying release and build data.

The dashboard also includes filtering capabilities, such as a search/select dropdown and date range picker, which allow users to slice and dice the data based on their specific needs and areas of interest.

In summary, this dashboard serves as a centralized hub for monitoring and analyzing an organization's GitHub activity, enabling engineering leaders to make data-driven decisions, identify areas for improvement, and track the overall health and productivity of their software development teams.
