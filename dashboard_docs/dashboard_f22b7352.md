## Description

The "Assets" dashboard provides a comprehensive view of an organization's asset management operations. It is designed to help asset managers, maintenance teams, and operations leaders monitor and analyze key performance indicators related to asset utilization, maintenance, and work activities.

The dashboard includes a variety of interactive components, including:

- Evolution numbers that track metrics over time, such as maintenance costs, hours spent, and PM (preventative maintenance) ratio

By combining these various data visualizations and filtering options, the dashboard empowers users to answer critical questions, such as:

- How are maintenance costs and labor hours trending over time?
- Are we meeting our preventative maintenance targets?
- Which assets have the longest lifespans, and what factors contribute to their longevity?
- What work has been performed on each individual asset, and when?

This dashboard consolidates data from multiple sources, providing a holistic view of the organization's asset management performance. It would be a valuable tool for asset managers, maintenance supervisors, and operations leaders who need to make data-driven decisions to optimize asset utilization, reduce maintenance costs, and ensure reliable operations.
