This helps the team track device inventory, ensure timely deployment, and identify any bottlenecks.

Each of the three main sections also includes "Week End Date" and "Assignee" dropdown filters, allowing users to quickly slice and dice the data by time period and the responsible technician. This flexibility enables the team to identify trends, pinpoint areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to enhance the overall technology services for the Cleveland ISD.
