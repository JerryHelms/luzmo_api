This dashboard is likely used by maintenance managers, operations leaders, and other stakeholders who need to oversee and manage the organization's preventive maintenance activities.

The dashboard includes several key components:

1. Dropdown filters: These allow users to easily filter the data by location, parent category, and specific category. This enables them to focus on specific areas of the business or asset types.

2. Date filters: Users can select a date range to view PM work orders created during a specific period. This helps them understand historical trends and plan future maintenance activities.
